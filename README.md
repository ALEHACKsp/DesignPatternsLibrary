# DesignPatternsLibrary

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code.
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
In addition, design patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions.

Know when to use a certain design pattern, and when not to.
No design pattern is a 42 â€“ the answer to life, the universe and everything. There are situations in which every design pattern easily becomes an antipattern.

This solution contains a comprehensive design patterns library implemented in C#, which covers various design patterns from the most commonly used ones to the lesser-known ones. It enables you to get familiar with and learn design patterns through moderately realistic examples.
